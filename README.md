# Deploy Static Website on AWS

## Objective

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.  I completed the following objectives:

* Created a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.

* Configured the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.

* Sped up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

* Access website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.

## Public URLs

Here are the list of URL's used (note: instances may not be on)
